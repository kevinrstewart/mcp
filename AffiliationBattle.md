# Overview
This is a proposal for a new user friendly format that aligns to affiliations and making a coherent list of related models vs aligning to the models that are available in the core set.

# List Construction

* A player must select a single Affiliation. All models selected must belong to this affiliation or have the _Rogue Agent_ special rule.
* A player must select up to 7 models
* A player must select up to 7 team tactics cards which must adhere to the [Banned and Restriced List](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/marvel/op)
* Each player must select 3 Secure Crisis Cards and 3 Extraction Crisis Cards
** The Tournament Organizer may take the context as a beginner event to possibly limit the set of crisis cards if the audience for the event is better suited to a more straightfoward set of Crisis Cards (for example: Mystic Wakandan Herb might be banned for this event)

# Tournament Organizer Recommendations

* Given the context as a new player event ample time to finsih games should be built into the schedule. Consider longer than average round times, and maybe a fixed number of rounds
* While chess clocks can be overwhelming some consideration to speed of play should be made to make sure every player is having a fair shot to compete within the time limits. The TO can consider a range of options but in general as a new player friendly format there might need to be a more active judging model that encourages people to have a sustainable pace of play.
* Terrain layout should be agreed upon and ambiguity of terrain size should be cleared up with an aid such as a legend on each table.
